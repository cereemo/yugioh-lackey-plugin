## Changes

These are changes between the LukeShortCloud fork and the original plugin.


### Breaking Changes

Existing decks may be broken with the changes listed here. Old and new card names are provided to help with the manual transition that is required by end-users.


#### Existing Alternative Artwork

The following changes have been made to improve existing and upcoming alternative artwork cards:
- Set changes. Alternative artwork cards are now listed from real sets instead of a fake "ALT" set.
    - Except for the Lost Art "LART" set.
- 1st edition artwork added. Some cards did not feature their actual 1st edition artwork.
- Unused card images have been removed. Some cards had two image files for the same card.
    - The best quality variant was kept.
- New standard for naming conventions.
    - "Alt Art NUMBER" describes which exact alternative artwork it is (some cards have more than one).
    - "Alt Txt NUMBER" describes the iteration of different effect text.
- Japanse artwork shown on English text cards has been renamed to "Uncensored". These are usually from official Asian-English sets.
- Duplicate cards have been removed. If possible, cards with better readability have been kept.
